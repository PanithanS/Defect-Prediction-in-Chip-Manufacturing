## Lithography in microchips manufacturing
A lithography (more formally known as ‘photolithography’) system is essentially a projection system. 
Light is projected through a blueprint of the pattern that will be printed (known as a ‘mask’ or ‘reticle’). 
The chips are made using a lithography process, which involves creating sophisticated patterns on a silicon wafer. 
This process is essential for manufacturing microchips used in various electronic devices. 
Lithography uses light to transfer these patterns onto the wafer, allowing for the precise creation of transistors and interconnections that make up the integrated circuit. 
This precise patterning is crucial for the chip to function correctly, making lithography a fundamental step in microchip manufacturing.
