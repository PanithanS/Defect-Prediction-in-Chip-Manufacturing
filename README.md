Lithography defect prediction for microchip manufacturing optimization with machine learning model

## Lithography process and chips manufacturing
Chips are made using a process called lithography, which involves creating intricate patterns on a silicon wafer using masks. This process is essential for manufacturing microchips used in various electronic devices. Lithography uses light to transfer these patterns onto the wafer through masks, allowing for the precise creation of transistors and interconnections that make up the integrated circuit. This precise patterning is crucial for the chip to function correctly, making lithography with masks a fundamental step in microchip manufacturing.
