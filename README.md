Over the past few decades, electronic devices such as computers, tablets, and smartphones have become integral to our daily lives. These devices function on the sophisticated electronic circuits they contain. Notably, electronic circuits have steadily decreased in size since the inception of semiconductors in 1940. Presently, we have silicon-based integrated circuits (ICs), often referred to as chips, packing more than 10,000 transistors into just a few square millimeters of space. The production of these chips involves a fascinating process. Initially, they are crafted on silicon wafers, which are circular thin slices of silicon material. Afterward, the wafer is carefully chopped into individual chips. The utilization of advanced lithography tools is the key to crafting these sophisticated electronic circuits, therefore it is crucial to optimize process control to reduce defects (die chips) for high-yield chip manufacturing.

## Lithography process and chip manufacturing

Chips are made using lithography, which involves creating intricate patterns on a silicon wafer using masks. This process is essential for manufacturing microchips used in various electronic devices. Lithography uses light to transfer these patterns onto the wafer through masks, allowing for the precise creation of transistors and interconnections that make up the integrated circuit. This precise patterning is crucial for the chip to function correctly, making lithography with masks a fundamental step in microchip manufacturing.

## Exposure optimization
Two parameters in exposure need to be considered:
1. Exposure energy (Energy)
2. Focal length (Focus)
